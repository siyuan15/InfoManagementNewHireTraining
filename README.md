## About 
Under the wisdom of our fearless leader we prepare to arm the next wave of recruits with 
the tricks and techniques they will need to hold off the constant onslaught of demos and POC requests. 

If you want to learn about managing data on Oracle cloud, feel free to follow along! 


## Our Workshops
Here we've collected the creme-de-la-creme of workhsops to get you up and running with Information Management on Oracle Cloud 
- Database Cloud Service (DBCS)
- Exadata Cloud Service 
- Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service 
- Big Data Cloud 
- Data Integration
- Data Science (with a focus on ML) on Oracle Cloud
- Data Management Red Stack 
- Object Storage
- Cloud Basics


### Database Cloud Service Workshop
Here we heavily borrow from Pat Davies and team on 
[Oracle's Learning Library](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library). 
Who have 3 workshops built around Oracle DB. 
* [dbcs](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/tree/master/workshops/dbcs) 
which introduces DBCS, covers cloud migration, and goes over backup & recovery
* [dbcs-dba](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/tree/master/workshops/dbcs-dbaa)
where you create a DBCS, migrate PDBs, and performat DBA tasks with the CLI 
* [dbcs-in-memory](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/tree/master/workshops/dbcs-in-memory) 
which is short but shows you how fast in-memory data is!

Over the next 2 days we are going to show you some cool features of Oracle Database
* Intro to DBCS; creating, customizing, and connecting 
* Multitenant Databases (CDBs and PDBs) 
* In-Memory Data 
* Application Express (APEX)
* New features in 12C and 18C 
* [OAA](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/advanced-analytics/overview/index.html)

### Exadata Cloud Service
Getting ahold of Exadata cloud environments is tricky so we're just going 
to do a knowledge dump on you. 
* What is Exadata?
* Why do I care? 
* How do I work it? 

### Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service 
This workshop is a submodule (basically a clone) of a workshop that our team 
put together for the release of Oracle's Autonomous Data Warehouse. Here we 
cover the basics of setting up ADWCS.  
In the future we'd like to explore a few more features of ADWCS, particularly ML. 
* What, Why, and How of ADWCS
* 

### Big Data Cloud 
This one is the fun one! David Bayard of Oracle has done a great job with his 
journeys (currently the first three 
[here](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/tree/master/workshops) 
cover BDC) so we've again borrowed heavily. David keeps these up to date 
so the journeys are a good BDC reference. 

## Data Integration
Oracle offers several tools to integrate data including 
* [Golden Gate](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/goldengate/overview/index.html)
* [Data Integration Process Cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/data-integration-platform)
* [Event Hub](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/event-hub)

### Data Science (with a focus on ML) on Oracle Cloud
Oracle offers plenty of technologies for data science. We'll try to cover most of them :) 
* AI options at Oracle - 
[OAA](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/advanced-analytics/overview/index.html), 
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), 
and [R](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/r/r-enterprise/overview/index.html)

### Data Management Red Stack 
Examples of how these services can be deployed together and a challange to build your 
own data mangement stack on Oracle's technologies

### Object Storage
A quick tutorial on the best ways to work with 
[OCI Storage](https://cloud.oracle.com/storage)

### Basics
All of the tools you'll use everyday, including
* GitHub & Documentation
* Virtual Machines (VMs)
* Linux
* Networking 

## Getting Started 
These tutorials will assume you have an Oracle Cloud account. If you don't, you can create a trial account 
[here](https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit). If you're a new-hire (or have a Oracle Cloud SE on hand) ask them and they'll help 
you get set up. 


Once you've got your cloud environment you're ready to get started. 
Go ahead to [welcome-to-im](/welcome-to-im) to get started
